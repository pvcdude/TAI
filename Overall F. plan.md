## ⚖️ Balance: Finance Lead vs Programming

- The **finance lead is still part of the programming effort**. They’re not “separate” — they just **shift 20–30% of their study time** into finance instead of going equally deep in _all_ programming topics.
    
- Example:
    
    - While the rest of the group spends 100% on ML fundamentals,
        
    - Finance lead spends ~70% ML/programming, 30% finance.
        

👉 That way, they stay capable in coding but become the “voice of reality” when it comes to financial markets.

It’s not about _sacrificing programming_, but about **dividing effort smartly**.  
If finance is ignored, the project dies. If programming is ignored, the AI doesn’t exist. Both need a balance.

You’re right — **basic finance literacy does NOT need 8 weeks**.  
If we’re talking **Finance 101** (assets, orders, risk, indicators, etc.), a motivated group can grasp the fundamentals in:

- ~1 week of focused study (say 2–3 group sessions, each ~2–3 hours).
    
- Then practice by watching markets daily (5–10 minutes per day).

## 📅 Optimized Finance Timeline

### Phase A (while learning Python/Stats):

- **Week 1 (Finance Bootcamp, group)**:
    
    - 2–3 sessions → cover market basics, risk, simple indicators.
        
    - Everyone gets to “finance 101” level.
        
- **Weeks 2–14 (Ongoing practice)**:
    
    - Each person spends maybe 10 min/day checking prices/news → keeps the concepts alive.
        
    - Finance lead reads a bit deeper (textbooks, strategy papers, backtesting frameworks).
        

### Phase B (January–March):

- Finance lead commits more time to:
    
    - Portfolio theory, risk-adjusted returns, drawdowns, leverage.
        
    - How to design realistic backtests.
        
- Group continues ML/programming; finance lead ensures strategies stay grounded.
    

### Phase C (March–July):

- Finance lead is fully integrated with ML team:
    
    - While models are tested, they set constraints and evaluate results.
        
    - Example: “This looks profitable, but with 25% drawdown it’s unusable.”

## ✅ Bottom Line

- **Everyone** learns finance basics fast (1 week is fine).
    
- **Ongoing practice** keeps it alive without huge time drain.
    
- **Finance lead** just goes deeper — but still codes/programs.
