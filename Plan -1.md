1. A high-level architecture you’ll implement.
    
2. A detailed week-by-week plan from **now (September)** through **June/July** with concrete deliverables and exit criteria.
    
3. Repo & code structure, examples, and tech stack.
    
4. Deep implementation notes (backtester design, accelerated replay, ML pipeline, reproducibility, testing, deployment, team workflow).
    
5. Key risks and how to avoid them.

If you follow this plan you’ll have a production-quality codebase and an automated pipeline you can hand off or scale.

# High-level architecture (programming components)

- **Data Ingest / Storage** — fetch, normalize, store time-series (parquet / sqlite / Postgres), caching layer.
    
- **Feature Pipeline** — transform raw OHLCV into feature sets, persist features. (Sklearn Pipelines)
    
- **Simulator / Backtester** — event-driven engine with fees/slippage model + accelerated replay.
    
- **Model Training Pipeline** — training scripts, cross-validation (time-series aware), hyperparameter tuning, checkpoints.
    
- **Inference / Orchestration** — runtime that loads model, computes features in real time, outputs decisions (abstract API).
    
- **Tools & DevOps** — repo, CI, tests, Docker, deployment scripts, monitoring, logs.
    
- **Docs & Tests** — comprehensive tests, usage docs, runbooks.

# Timeline & week-by-week plan (programming-only)

Assumptions: you have weekdays free in September (no classes) so you can move fast. I break months into weeks. Each week has **one prime deliverable** (so you can measure progress). Workload ~15–25 hours/week; if teammates share, assign tasks in parallel but align on weekly syncs.

# Key implementation details (deep tech notes)

### Backtester: event-driven vs vectorized

- **Vectorized**: fast, simple, good for rule prototypes. Use for early exploration.
    
- **Event-driven**: realistic. Design:
    
    - Event types: `CANDLE`, `ORDER_SUBMIT`, `ORDER_FILL`, `CANCEL`.
        
    - Order simulation: on submit, compute slippage based on volume and simulated book depth.
        
    - Fill logic: partial fills allowed; fees applied at fill.
        
- **No-lookahead** rule: features for timestamp `t` must use data ≤ `t`. Validate with unit tests.
    

### Accelerated replay

- Implement `ReplayRunner(iterable_of_candles, speed_factor)` that feeds events to your event loop at `min_delay = candle_dt / speed_factor`. For offline testing you can set `speed_factor` so 6 months -> hours. Ensure RNG seeds recorded.
    

### Slippage & fees

- Model: `fill_price = mid + sign * (spread/2) + slippage_pct * volatility`.
    
- Fees: percentage per trade; model as deducted from executed amount.
    

### Time-series CV & walk-forward

- Use expanding-window walk-forward: train on `[t0..t1]`, validate `[t1..t2]`, then roll by step.
    
- Do not use standard k-fold; it leaks. Automate the windows in `src/models/cv.py`.
    

### Feature store & pipelining

- Use scikit-learn `Pipeline` for scaling + feature selectors. Save transformers with model joblib.
    
- Persist features as parquet keyed by timestamp and symbol so training and inference match exactly.
    

### Reproducibility & randomness

- Single config file `config.yaml` with seeds, paths, parameters.
    
- Always set `np.random.seed`, `random.seed`, and for torch: `torch.manual_seed` and `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)` where possible.
    
- Record versions of libraries (pip freeze) with each experiment.
    

### ML training & experiments

- For baseline: RandomForest/XGBoost for tabular features. Later: small LSTM or 1D Conv if justified.
    
- Use early stopping, checkpointing, and consistent evaluation metrics (PFC: profit factor, AUC for classification, Sharpe for predicted PnL).
    
- Save training artifacts with metadata: dataset hashes, params, seed.
    

### Tests

- Unit tests for: data ingest, indicator outputs (known inputs → known outputs), order simulation math, serialization, config loader.
    
- Integration tests: run a micro replay with deterministic RNG and compare final equity to golden output.
    
- Regression tests: keep a small golden dataset and expected equity curve numbers.
    

### CI & quality

- Pre-commit hooks: `black`, `isort`, `ruff`/`flake8`.
    
- CI pipeline: lint → unit tests → build docker image.
    
- Require PRs & 1 reviewer before merge.
    

### DevOps, containers & deploy

- Use Docker for production parity.
    
- Use a small VPS (Hetzner/Contabo) for 24/7 tests; deploy via docker-compose or systemd + docker.
    
- Use cron or Prefect for scheduling tasks (data refresh, nightly replays).
    

### Secrets & keys

- Keep API keys out of code. Use environment variables and `.env` files in dev, and vault/secret manager in production.
    
- Never log secrets.

# Team workflow & roles (programming)

- **Data Engineer** — ingestion, storage, schema, EDA.
    
- **ML Engineer** — features, models, training pipeline.
    
- **Software Engineer / DevOps** — simulator, CI, deployment, monitoring.
    
- **QA / Tester** — writes integration/regression tests, runs stress tests.
    

Work in 1-week sprints. Do daily 10–15 minute syncs (even async with a single message).

---

# First-week quick start checklist (commands)

Run these in terminal (on your laptop) to bootstrap:

`# 1. create project folder and venv mkdir trading-ai && cd trading-ai python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  # 2. init git + basic files git init echo "venv/" > .gitignore pip install --upgrade pip pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pytest black flake8 joblib  # 3. create skeleton mkdir -p src/{data,features,backtest,models,services,utils} tests notebooks data touch README.md git add . git commit -m "bootstrap"`

---

# Acceptance criteria for each phase (what “done” looks like)

- **Data pipeline**: can fetch, validate, and read 6 months of 1-min data reproducibly.
    
- **Backtester**: event-driven simulator produces expected equity for baseline strategy and supports fees/slippage.
    
- **Model pipeline**: trains, saves, and loads models deterministically; supports walk-forward CV.
    
- **E2E**: a single command reproduces training + backtest + report.
    
- **Deployment**: stack runs in Docker on a VPS with logging and basic alerts.
    

---

# Biggest technical risks & mitigations (programming)

- **Data quality issues** → Build validation checks and fail-fast (gap detection, duplicates).
    
- **Silent logic bugs in simulator** → Golden regression tests and reproducible small replays.
    
- **Overfitting the pipeline** → Use time-aware CV and walk-forward.
    
- **Environment drift** → Dockerize and record dependency hashes.
    
- **Complexity creep** → Deliver minimal MVP then iterate.
