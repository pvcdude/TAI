# 🚀 Phase C (Weeks 29–44) July: Stress-Testing, Scaling & Pre-Deployment

---

## **Weeks 29–32: Advanced Modeling**

- **Goal**: Push beyond simple models → explore deep learning & hybrid setups.
    
- **What you’ll learn**:
    
    - LSTMs/GRUs (recurrent neural nets) for time-series.
        
    - 1D CNNs for pattern recognition in price series.
        
    - Transformers for sequences (applied to financial time-series).
        
    - Feature importance analysis → which indicators truly matter.
        
- **Deliverable**: Train at least one deep learning model and compare vs your Phase B best.
    

👉 Deep nets are risky in finance — but testing them here shows if the added complexity is worth it.

## **Weeks 33–36: Robustness & Generalization**

- **Goal**: Make sure the model doesn’t collapse in unseen conditions.
    
- **What you’ll learn**:
    
    - Cross-market testing (train on BTC, test on ETH, etc.).
        
    - Cross-period testing (bull market vs bear market).
        
    - Regime detection (volatility clustering, trend vs chop).
        
    - Adversarial stress tests (inject fake bad data, sudden drops).
        
- **Deliverable**: A “robustness report” — can your model handle multiple markets and market regimes?
    

👉 This is where most academic models fail — but you’ll know it before risking money.

---

## **Weeks 37–39: Portfolio & Capital Allocation**

- **Goal**: Move from “1 asset” → “portfolio of strategies/assets.”
    
- **What you’ll learn**:
    
    - Diversification math (covariance, correlation matrices).
        
    - Portfolio optimization (mean-variance, Kelly across assets).
        
    - Ensemble of models (different algos trading in parallel).
        
- **Deliverable**: Simulate trading with 2–3 strategies at once.
    

👉 This makes you less dependent on a single fragile edge.

---

## **Weeks 40–41: Infrastructure & Scaling**

- **Goal**: Upgrade from “laptop script” → resilient system.
    
- **What you’ll learn**:
    
    - Running bot continuously on a cloud server (AWS, GCP, VPS).
        
    - Logging & monitoring trades in real-time (Grafana, Prometheus optional).
        
    - Automatic failover → restart bot if it crashes.
        
- **Deliverable**: Bot runs 24/7 for a week on a remote server with logging.
    

👉 At this point, your AI is production-ready.

---

## **Weeks 42–44: Paper → Real Transition**

- **Goal**: Transition from testing to live money carefully.
    
- **What you’ll learn**:
    
    - API integration with a broker/exchange in real-money mode.
        
    - Risk scaling: start with €50–€100, then scale if stable.
        
    - Daily/weekly reporting: PnL, drawdowns, errors.
        
- **Deliverable**: First real-money trade, logged and verified.
    

👉 You’ve gone from **data → model → simulation → live deployment**.

# 🧠 What You’ll Know After Phase C

By the end of ~11 months (Phase A + B + C):  
✅ Deep understanding of ML models, incl. deep learning for time-series.  
✅ How to stress-test across different markets & regimes.  
✅ How to combine multiple strategies into a portfolio.  
✅ How to deploy and maintain a 24/7 trading bot on the cloud.  
✅ How to transition safely from paper to real-money trading.

⚠️ **Biggest difference from Phase B**:

- Phase B = _you have a working prototype_.
    
- Phase C = _you try to break it from every angle before trusting it with real money_.
