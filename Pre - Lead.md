# 🗂️ Pre-Finance-Lead Plan (Shared by Everyone)

## **Phase 0: Kickoff (September, Week 1)**

- **Day 1–2: Group meeting**
    
    - Everyone aligns on goals: _AI for trading, roles will split later_.
        
    - Clarify: “we will ALL learn a baseline of finance so nobody is blind.”
        
- **Day 3–7: Finance 101 Bootcamp (group)**  
    Everyone studies together → no lead yet.  
    Content:
    
    1. **Market Basics** → What stocks/crypto/forex are, how exchanges work.
        
    2. **Trading Orders** → Market, limit, stop-loss.
        
    3. **Risk Concepts** → drawdown, leverage, volatility.
        
    4. **Basic Indicators** → EMA, RSI, MACD (just theory).
        
    5. **OHLCV Data** → how price/time is stored and used for backtesting.
        

Method:

- 2–3 group sessions (~2–3 hrs each).
    
- Each person summarizes one concept for the group.
    

**Goal:** By end of week 1, everyone has same “finance vocabulary.”

## **Phase A (Weeks 2–6, in parallel with Python/Stats)**

- Finance side is _lightweight_ → only **10 minutes/day per person**.
    
- Task: **Track one market** (e.g., BTC/USD, Apple stock, or EUR/USD).
    
    - Write down daily closing price.
        
    - Note: “up or down,” maybe 1–2 news headlines.
        

This builds _intuition_ about market movement without draining time.

---

## **Decision Point (End of Week 6–7)**

- Group check-in: “Who naturally enjoyed finance tracking the most?”
    
- Pick **finance lead** based on:
    
    1. Who shows most curiosity about markets.
        
    2. Who doesn’t mind reading extra outside sessions.
        
    3. Who is okay being the “realism filter” for AI experiments.

From this point → finance lead goes deeper, the rest keep mostly programming focus.
✅ So before you pick a finance lead, everyone:

1. Does the **Finance 101 Bootcamp** (week 1).
    
2. Tracks markets lightly (weeks 2–6).
    
3. Decides on lead around week 6–7.
