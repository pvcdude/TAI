# 📅 Month 2 – Indicators & Calculus (October)

### **Weeks 5–6: Data Analysis & Indicators**

**Core Topics**

- Rolling windows → moving average, rolling variance.
    
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
    
- Relative Strength Index (RSI).
    
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
    
- Correlation: asset relationships (BTC–ETH, BTC–S&P500).
    

**Practical Work**

- Write functions for SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD.
    
- Compare your results against `pandas_ta` / `talib`.
    
- Plot indicator overlays on candlestick charts.
    
- Build correlation heatmaps across multiple assets.
    

**Deliverable:** Notebook that calculates EMA, RSI, MACD for BTC + ETH and plots them with price.

👉 **Skill learned:** replicate basic **TradingView chart analysis** yourself.

### **Week 7: Calculus Refresher**

**Core Topics**

- Derivatives = slope = rate of change.
    
- Integrals = cumulative → total returns.
    
- Optimization basics (max/min, convexity).
    
- Gradient descent → how ML “learns.”
    

**Practical Work**

- Plot derivative of price curves (daily returns).
    
- Compute cumulative returns via integration.
    
- Implement gradient descent to minimize a quadratic cost function.
    

**Deliverable:** Python script `gradient_descent.py` → shows iterations converging.

👉 **Skill learned:** connect **market math** (returns, slopes) to **ML training math**.
